# Solubility Prediction Model

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the solubility of chemical compounds based on molecular descriptors. It was developed as part of my research in Professor Connor Bischak's lab at the University of Utah.

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to accurately predict compound solubility using features derived from SMILES strings and cheminformatics tools. The model is trained and evaluated using real-world datasets, leveraging Python data science libraries.

# Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering from SMILES strings
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation using scikit-learn
- Metrics: RÂ² score, MAE, MSE
- Optional support for future deployment and expansion

# Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn
- RDKit (for molecular descriptor generation, if applicable)

# Dataset
Due to GitHub size limitations, large dataset files are not included here. Please contact me or refer to the script `data_loader.py` for instructions on downloading the data.

# Running the Model
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bodiegeb/solubility-ml.git
   cd solubility-ml
